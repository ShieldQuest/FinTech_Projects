Streamlit Web Apps

This folder contains the interactive web applications I've built using Python and Streamlit. 
Each app is designed to explore basic ideas in finance, data, or personal improvement while helping me grow as a developer.

What's included:
- Beginner-friendly code
- Real-time interaction through sliders, checkboxes, and inputs
- Simple logic for learning and experimentation

These apps are for educational and practice purposes onlyâ€”not real financial advice or services.
